# GifGetter
# Author: Garret Rueckert
## Hits the Giphy API with custom requests to return several gifs on the page.

### To use:
    Simply open the *stylishly designed* sidebar, click one of the green gif buttons, or add your own custom gif button with the text box and grey button.

    The yellow reset button removes all buttons (and existing gifs on the page) to clear room for more custom buttons.
